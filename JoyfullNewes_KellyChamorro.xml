        <lb/>as in that which is called the <placeName>Peru</placeName>, where there are manie

        <lb/> of Golde and Silver, that it is a thing worthy of admirati-

        <lb/>on the great number of <unclear> Melons</unclear>,<!-- not sure if the right word here (will look back during proofing) --> which have come from
        <lb/>thence, besides the great quantity of pearles which have sto-
        <lb/>red the whole world: also they doe bring from those partes,
        <lb/>Popingaies, Griffons, Apes, Lions, Gerfaucons, &amp;
        <lb/>other kinds of Daukes, Tigers wool, Cotton wool, Graine to die
        <lb/>coloures with al, Dides, Sugars, Coppar, Brasill, the wood

        <lb/>there commeth every yeere, <num>one hundred</num> ships laden there-
        <lb/>with, that it is a great thing, and an incredible riches. </p>
     <p> And besides these great riches, our <placeName>Occidentall Indias</placeName>
        <lb/>Doe send unto us many Trees, Plants, Hearbes, Rootes,
        <lb/>Juices, Gummes, Fruites, <choice><orig>Licoures</orig><reg>Liquors</reg></choice> &amp; Stones that are of
        <lb/>great medicinall vertues, in the which there be founde, and

        <lb/>much in value and price all the aforesayed thinges, by so
        <lb/>muche as the copporall health is more excellent, and nece-

           <lb/> the worlde, which were not knowne untill our time, and
           <lb/>the people of olde time did lacke them, but Time which is
           <lb/>the discoverer of all thinges, hath discovered them unto us
           <lb/>greatly to our profite, considering the greate neede that wee
           <lb/>hav of them.</p>
       <p>And as there are discovered new regions, newe king-
           <lb/>domes, and newe provinces, by our Spaniards, so they
          <lb/>have brought unto us newe Medicines, and newe Reme-
          <lb/>dies, wherewith they doe cure many infirmities, which, if
          <lb/>we did lacke them, would bee incurable, and without anye
          <lb/>remedy: of which thinges although that some have know-
          <lb/>ledge, yet they be not common too all people, for which
          <lb/>cause I did pretend to treate, and to write, of all things that
          <lb/>they bring from our <placeName>Indias</placeName>, Apperteyning to the arte and
          <lb/>use of Medicine, and the remedie of the hurtes and diseases
          <lb/>that we doe suffer and endure, whereof no small profite
          <lb/>doeth follow to those of our time, and also unto them that
          <lb/>shall come after us: in the bewraying whereof I shall be the
          <lb/> first, that the rather the followers may adde thereunto, with

        <p>And as in this Cities of <placeName rend="italics">Seuill</placeName>, which is the Porte and

       <pb/>
           <lb/>brought in certaine great peeces, which are like too pee-

           <lb/>but not so good as the <name rend="italics">Anime</name>: with this <name rend="italics">Copall</name>, the Indi-
           <lb/>ans did make perfumes in their sacrifices, &amp; to the use there-
           <lb/>of was frequented in the Temples, by their Priestes.</p>
        <p>And when the first Spaniardes went to those partes,
           <lb/>these priestes went out to receive them, with little firepots,
           <lb/>burning in them this <name rend="italics">Copall</name>, and geving to them the smoke
           <lb/>of it at their noses: wee doe use heere to perfume with it in
           <lb/>diseases rising upon coldenesse of the head, in the place of
           <lb/>Incence, or <name rend="italics">Anime</name>: it is hotte in the seconde degree, and

        <p>The <name rend="italics">Anime</name> is a gumme of Rosine of a greate Treem
           <lb/>it is white, it draweth neere to the coulour of Incence, it is

           <lb/>ry acceptable and pleasaunt smell, and put uppon burning
          <lb/>coals, it doth consume very quickely.</p>
        <p>It differeth from our <name rend="italics">Anime</name>, that it is brought from

           <lb/>which is called Amber congeled, wherwith they doe make
           <lb/>Beades, but it not so, for that the <name rend="italics">Charabe</name> is a kinde of
           <lb/>Pitche, that is founde in the <placeName>Germayne Sea</placeName>, and it is ta-
           <lb/>ken out of the Sea in great peeces, with a dragge of Iron, 
           <lb/>so that it seemth to come foorth of some fountaines, into
           <lb/>the Sea, after the manner of pitch, and beeing come foorthe
           <lb/>unto the colde ayre, it congeleth, for becayse there is scene in
           <lb/>the same, peeces of stickes, &amp; other superfluities of the Sea,
           <lb/>cleaving unto it, and in this they shall see the errour of them,
           <lb/>that say that it is Gumme of <name rend="italics">Alamo</name>; and of others, that it
           <lb/>is of the pinetree.</p>

      <p>That which is brought from the <placeName>newe Spaine</placeName>, is ga-

           <lb/>for the griefe of the head, and paines therof, caused of hu-

         <lb/>thereof doeth proceede, after evacuation, perfuming there-
         <lb/> with the chambers in the Winter season: and where as are
         <lb/>generall infirmities, it doeth purifie and correct the Aire,
         <lb/>and they doe perfume therewith their head kerchers, when <!-- do you recognize this word -->
         <lb/>that they doe goe to sleepe: for them that doe suffer paines

         <lb/>the head unto such as have it debilited, or weakened, and
         <lb/>doe suffer paines by occasion thereof: they doe put it also
         <lb/>in plaisters, and in seere clothes, where as is neede of com- <!-- go back to this (means dry, don't correct this to dry) -->
         <lb/>fort, and to dissolve, especially cold humours, or windiness:
         <lb/>they doe use it also in place of Incence, as well in the per-
         <lb/>fumes, as in the aforesaide.</p> 
      <p>It doeth comfort the braine, applied in the forme of a

           <lb/>being full of sinewes, made after the fashion of a Sere <!-- same here just dry cloth -->
           <lb/>cloth with the third parte of Waxe: it taketh out the cold of
           <lb/>any member, whatsoeverr, being applied thereuntoo for a
           <lb/>long time, with refreshing it. It is hotte in the second de-

          <lb/>an other kinde of Gumme or Rosine, which the

          <lb/>name did our Spaniard give it, it is Rosine
      <pb/>
          <lb/>taken out by incision of a tree, being as great as a Willow
          <lb/>tree, and is of a berie sweete smell, it bringeth foorth a red
          <lb/>fruite, as the seede of pionia.</p>
       <p>This Rosine on Gumme, the Indians doe much use in
          <lb/>their infirmities, chiefly in the swellinges in any part of the bo-
          <lb/>die, wheresoever they bee <choice><orig>ingendred</orig><reg>injured</reg></choice>, for that it dissolveth,
          <lb/>ripeneth, and marvellously desolveth them. And even so, it
          <lb/>taketh awaie any manner of <choice><orig>greefe</orig><reg>grief</reg></choice>, that is come of a colde
          <lb/>cause: as humours, and windinesse: this th Indians doe use
          <lb/>very commonly, and familiarly. And for this effect the Spa-
          <lb/>niardes hath brought it.</p>
       <p>The colour is as the colour of <name rend="italics">Galmano</name>, and some doe
          <lb/>say that it is the same, it hath white partes like to <name rend="italics">Amoni-
          <lb/>aco</name>, it is of a good smel, and the tail is like, insomuch that be-
          <lb/>in cast upon hotte burning <choice><orig>coles</orig><reg>coals</reg></choice>, and giving the smoke
          <lb/>thereof at the <choice><orig>nase</orig><reg>nose</reg></choice> of a woman that doth swoone, or els hath
          <lb/>lost her feeling by suffocation of the mother, it doeth cause
          <lb/>her to come quickely, and easily to her selfe. And the Rosine
          <lb/>putte to her navell, after the manner of a plaister, causeth
          <lb/>the Mother to keepe in her place: and the use thereof is so
          <lb/>much amongeth women, that the most parte which is spent
          <lb/>thereof, if for this effect, for that they doe finde themselves
          <lb/>very much eased by it, taking awaie from them all manner
          <lb/>of chokinges of the Mother, and comforting the stomacke.
          <lb/>Some that bee curious doe adde thereuntoo Amber and
          <lb/>Muske, and so it is better then alone. It is <choice><orig>alwaies</orig><reg>always</reg></choice> fixed,
          <lb/>without melting of it selfe, untill that it bee all wholie wa-
          <lb/>sted. </p>
       <p>And where it doeth most profite, is for to take awaie
             <lb/>any manner of griefe caused of colde humours and windie,
             <lb/>and beeing applied unto them in manner of a plaister, it ta-
             <lb/>keth them away, and dissolveth them with greate admira-
             <lb/>tion: it doeth cleave in such sorte, that until it hath done,
             <lb/>and wrought his effect, it can not bee taken away, and the
             <lb/>selfe same it doeth, being laide uppon swellinges, for that it
       <pb/>
          <lb/>consumeth and desolveth them, and if there bee any desire to
          <lb/>ripen them, it doeth it, and that very quickly.</p>
        <p>It is also a remedie verified, and experimented
           <lb/>that it doeth profite much in <choice><orig>Reumes</orig><reg>Rheums</reg></choice> <!-- are they saying rooms here?(rheums) -->, and Runnings,

           <lb/>hinde both the eares, or the eare on the parte which run-
           <lb/>neth, for that it doeth restraine the running of them: and ap-
           <lb/>plied unto the temples of the head, in manner of a plaister,
           <lb/>it doeth withholde the runnings and the fluxe, that runneth <!--flux is a symptom-->
           <lb/>to the eyes, and to the partes of the face: it taketh away the
           <lb/><choice><orig>toth</orig><reg>tooth</reg></choice> ache, although that the <choice><orig>tothe</orig><reg>tooth</reg></choice> bee hollowe, and if therewith the
           <lb/>rotten <choice><orig>tothe</orig><reg>tooth</reg></choice> be burned, it maketh that the corruption goeth
           <lb/>no further: and being laide after the manner of a plaister in
           <lb/>the hollownesse of the necke, or griefe of the shoulders, it
           <lb/>taketh away the paynes: mingled with the thirde parte of
           <lb/><unclear>storax</unclear>, and a little Amber made in a plaister, for the sto-
           <lb/>macke, it doeth comfort it, and causeth appetite to meate,
           <lb/>it helpeth digestion, and dissolveth windines: after the same
           <lb/>sort put upon the moulde of the head, it comforteth, and ta-
           <lb/>keth away the paines thereof. In the Sciatica, or paynes
           <lb/>of the <choice><orig>hippes</orig><reg>hips</reg></choice> put thereunto, the effect thereof is greate:
           <lb/>and likewise it is so in all paynes of the <choice><orig>ioyntes</orig><reg>joints</reg></choice>: and in any
           <lb/>payne of the body whersoever, it be, chiefly if it come of cold
           <lb/>humours, or <choice><orig>mixt</orig><reg>mixed</reg></choice>: For because with this resolution, it hath
           <lb/>partes of binding, which doe give a marvellous comfor-

           <lb/>use thereof is so celebrated, that the people knowe no other
           <lb/>remedy for any grief, but only the use of this Rosine, so that

        <lb/>now in our parties it is much esteemed, for the great effects
        <lb/>that it doth worke.</p>  
     <p>It doth profit and heale the same infirmities, that the <name rend="italics">Ta-
