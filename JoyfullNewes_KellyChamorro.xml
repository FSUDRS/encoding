        <lb/>Doe send unto us many Trees, Plants, Hearbes, Rootes, <!-- another list of same type-->

           <lb/>the people of olde time did lacke them, but Time which is
           <lb/>the discoverer of all thinges, hath discovered them unto us
           <lb/>greatly to our profite, considering the greate neede that wee
           <lb/>hav of them.</p>
       <p>And as there are discovered new regions, newe king-
           <lb/>domes, and newe provinces, by our Spaniards, so they
          <lb/>have brought unto us newe Medicines, and newe Reme-
          <lb/>dies, wherewith they doe cure many infirmities, which, if
          <lb/>we did lacke them, would bee incurable, and without anye
          <lb/>remedy: of which thinges although that some have know-
          <lb/>ledge, yet they be not common too all people, for which
          <lb/>cause I did pretend to treate, and to write, of all things that
          <lb/>they bring from our <placeName>Indias</placeName>, Apperteyning to the arte and
          <lb/>use of Medicine, and the remedie of the hurtes and diseases
          <lb/>that we doe suffer and endure, whereof no small profite
          <lb/>doeth follow to those of our time, and also unto them that

           <lb/>Rosine berie white, and of much brightnesse, it is
        <pb/>
           <lb/>brought in certaine great peeces, which are like too pee-
           <lb/>ces of <hi rend="italics">Diacitron</hi> very cleare, it hath and indifferent smell,
           <lb/>but not so good as the <hi rend="italics">Anime</hi>: with this <hi rend="italics">Copall</hi>, the Indi-
           <lb/>ans did make perfumes in their sacrifices, &amp; to the use there-
           <lb/>of was frequented in the Temples, by their Priestes.</p>
        <p>And when the first Spaniardes went to those partes,
           <lb/>these priestes went out to receive them, with little firepots,
           <lb/>burning in them this <hi rend="italics">Copall</hi>, and geving to them the smoke
           <lb/>of it at their noses: wee doe use heere to perfume with it in
           <lb/>diseases rising upon coldenesse of the head, in the place of
           <lb/>Incence, or <hi rend="italics">Anime</hi>: it is hotte in the seconde degree, and
           <lb/>moyst in the first, it is resoluative, and softneth by some <choice><orig>wa-
           <lb/>trish </orig> <reg>waterish</reg></choice>partes, that it hath.</p>
        <p>The <hi rend="italics">Anime</hi> is a gumme of Rosine of a greate Treem
           <lb/>it is white, it draweth neere to the coulour of Incence, it is
           <lb/> more oyly then the <hi rend="italics">Copall</hi> is, it commeth in graines, as the
           <lb/>Incence doeth, although somewhat greater, and beyng bro-
           <lb/>ken, it hath a yellowe collour, as Rosine hath: it is of a be-
           <lb/>ry acceptable and pleasaunt smell, and put uppon burning
          <lb/>coals, it doth consume very quickely.</p>
        <p>It differeth from our <hi rend="italics">Anime</hi>, that it is brought from
           <lb/><placeName rend="italics">Lenante</placeName>, which is not so white, nor so bright, insomuche
           <lb/>that some doe say, that it is spice of <hi rend="italics">Charabe</hi> or <hi rend="italics">succino</hi>, 
           <lb/>which is called Amber congeled, wherwith they doe make
           <lb/>Beades, but it not so, for that the <hi rend="italics">Charabe</hi> is a kinde of
           <lb/>Pitche, that is founde in the <placeName>Germayne Sea</placeName>, and it is ta-
           <lb/>ken out of the Sea in great peeces, with a dragge of Iron, 
           <lb/>so that it seemth to come foorth of some fountaines, into
           <lb/>the Sea, after the manner of pitch, and beeing come foorthe
           <lb/>unto the colde ayre, it congeleth, for becayse there is scene in
           <lb/>the same, peeces of stickes, &amp; other superfluities of the Sea,
           <lb/>cleaving unto it, and in this they shall see the errour of them,
           <lb/>that say that it is Gumme of <hi rend="italics">Alamo</hi>; and of others, that it
