      <p>THE FIRST PART OF
         THIS BOKE TREATETH OF THE
         thinges that are brought from the <span class="placeName">Occidentall Indias</span>, which
         serve for the use of Medicine, and of the order that must
         be kept in taking the roote called Mechoacan, wherein
         are discovered great secretes of Nature, and great
         experiences: made and complied by Do
         ctor <span class="persName">Monardus</span>, <span class="choice"><a class="orig">Phisition</a><a class="reg">Physician</a></span> of <span class="placeName">Seuill</span>. </p>
      
      <p>
         <span style="text-transform:uppercase; font-size:200%;">I</span>n the yere of our Lord God,
         a thousand, foure hundreth nine-
         tie two, our Spaniards were
         governed by sir <span class="persName">Christopher
            <span class="choice"><a class="orig">Colon</a><a class="reg">Columbus</a></span></span>, being Naturally born in
         the countrie of <span class="placeName">Genova</span>, to disco-
         ver the <span class="placeName">Occidental Indias</span>, that
         are called this day, the <span class="placeName">newe
            world</span>, and they discovered the
         first land thereof, the xi, day of
         October, of the said yere: &amp; from that time unto this. they
         have discovered many &amp; sundry laandes, and muche firme
         land, as wel in that countrie, which they cal the <span class="placeName">new Spaine</span>,
         as in that which is called the <span class="placeName">Peru</span>, where there are manie
         provinces, many kingdomes, and many cities, that have
         contrary and <span class="choice"><a class="orig">divers</a><a class="reg">diverse</a></span> customes in them, in which there have
         beene founde out, thinges that never in these partes, nor in
         any other partes of the worlde have beene seene, nor unto
         this day knowen: and other thinges which nowe are
         brought unto us in greate abundance, that is to say, Gold,
         Silver, Pearles, Emeraldes, Turkeies, &amp; other fine stones
         of great value. Yet great is the excelle and quantitie that
          hath come, and every <span class="choice"><a class="orig">daie</a><a class="reg">day</a></span> doeth come, and inespecially
          of Golde and Silver, that it is a thing worthy of admirati-
         
         on the great number of Melons, which have come from
         thence, besides the great quantity of pearles which have sto-
         red the whole world: also they doe bring from those partes,
         Popingaies, Griffons, Apes, Lions, Gerfaucons, &amp;
         other kinds of Daukes, Tigers wool, Cotton wool, Graine to die
         coloures with al, Dides, Sugars, Coppar, Brasill, the wood
         <em class="name">Ebano AMill</em>: and all of these, there is to great quantity, that
         there commeth every yeere, one hundred ships laden there-
         with, that it is a great thing, and an incredible riches. </p>
      
      <p> And besides these great riches, our <span class="placeName">Occidentall Indias</span>
         Doe send unto us many Trees, Plants, Hearbes, Rootes,
         Juices, Gummes, Fruites, <span class="choice"><a class="orig">Licoures</a><a class="reg">Liquors</a></span> &amp; Stones that are of
         great medicinall vertues, in the which there be founde, and
         have been found in them, very great effectes that doe exceeede
         much in value and price all the aforesayed thinges, by so
         muche as the copporall health is more excellent, and nece-
         sary then the temporall goodes: the which thinges all
         the world doth lackes, the want whereof is not a little <span class="unclear">burte- 
            full</span>, according to the greate profite which wee doe see, by
          the use of them to follow, not onely in our <span class="placeName">Spayne</span>, but also
          in all the world.</p>
      
      <p>And this is not toe bee <span class="choice"><a class="orig">meruelled</a><a class="reg">marvelled</a></span> at, that it is so, for the
         philosopher doeth say, that all countries doe not yeelde
         Plantes and Fruites alike: for one Region yeeldeth such
         Fruites, Treese, and Plantes as an other doeth not: wee
          doe see that in <em class="placeName">Creta</em> onely groweth the <em class="name">Diptamo</em>, and the 
          Incence onely in the region of <em class="placeName">Saba</em>, and the <em class="name">Almaciga</em>
         Onely in the Lande of <em class="placeName">Chio</em>, and the Sinamon, Cloves,
         and Peper, and other spices onely in the Landes of the <em class="placeName">Ada-
            luca</em>, and many other thinges you have in <span class="choice"><a class="orig">divers</a><a class="reg">diverse</a></span> partes of
          the worlde, which were not knowne untill our time, and
         the people of olde time did lacke them, but Time which is
         the discoverer of all thinges, hath discovered them unto us
         greatly to our profite, considering the greate neede that wee
         hav of them.</p>
      
      <p>And as there are discovered new regions, newe king-
         domes, and newe provinces, by our Spaniards, so they
         have brought unto us newe Medicines, and newe Reme-
         dies, wherewith they doe cure many infirmities, which, if
         we did lacke them, would bee incurable, and without anye
         remedy: of which thinges although that some have know-
         ledge, yet they be not common too all people, for which
         cause I did pretend to treate, and to write, of all things that
         they bring from our <span class="placeName">Indias</span>, Apperteyning to the arte and
         use of Medicine, and the remedie of the hurtes and diseases
         that we doe suffer and endure, whereof no small profite
         doeth follow to those of our time, and also unto them that
         shall come after us: in the bewraying whereof I shall be the
          first, that the rather the followers may adde thereunto, with
         this beginning, that which they shal more know, and by ex-
         perience hereafter finde out. </p>
      
      <p>And as in this Cities of <em class="placeName">Seuill</em>, which is the Porte and
         skale of all the <span class="placeName">Occidentall Indias</span>, we doe knowe of them
         more, then in any other partes of all <span class="placeName">Spayne</span>, for bicause
         that al thinges come firsthither, where by better intelligence
         and greater experience it is learned: so doe I, with practice
         and use of them this fourtie yeeres , that which I doe cure in
         this Citie, where I have informed my selfe of them, that
         have brought these thinges out of those partes with muche
         care,and I have made experience thereof with many and
         <span class="choice"><a class="orig">divers</a><a class="reg">diverse</a></span> persons, with all diligence and foresight possible, and 
         with much happy successe.</p>

         <h2>Of the Anime and Copall.</h2>
         <p> 
            <span style="text-transform:uppercase; font-size:200%;">T</span>her do bring from the new <span class="placeName">Spaine</span> 2. kinds of Ro-
            sine, that be both much alike one to the other, the one
            is called <em class="name">Copall</em>, and the other <em class="name">Anime</em>. The <em class="name">Copall</em> is a
            Rosine berie white, and of much brightnesse, it is
            
            brought in certaine great peeces, which are like too pee-
            ces of <em class="name">Diacitron</em> very cleare, it hath and indifferent smell,
            but not so good as the <em class="name">Anime</em>: with this <em class="name">Copall</em>, the Indi-
            ans did make perfumes in their sacrifices, &amp; to the use there-
            of was frequented in the Temples, by their Priestes.</p>
         
         <p>And when the first Spaniardes went to those partes,
            these priestes went out to receive them, with little firepots,
            burning in them this <em class="name">Copall</em>, and geving to them the smoke
            of it at their noses: wee doe use heere to perfume with it in
            diseases rising upon coldenesse of the head, in the place of
            Incence, or <em class="name">Anime</em>: it is hotte in the seconde degree, and
            moyst in the first, it is resoluative, and softneth by some <span class="choice"><a class="orig">wa-
                  trish </a> <a class="reg">waterish</a></span>partes, that it hath.</p>
         
         <p>The <em class="name">Anime</em> is a gumme of Rosine of a greate Treem
            it is white, it draweth neere to the coulour of Incence, it is
             more oyly then the <em class="name">Copall</em> is, it commeth in graines, as the
            Incence doeth, although somewhat greater, and beyng bro-
            ken, it hath a yellowe collour, as Rosine hath: it is of a be-
            ry acceptable and pleasaunt smell, and put uppon burning
            coals, it doth consume very quickely.</p>
         
         <p>It differeth from our <em class="name">Anime</em>, that it is brought from
            <em class="placeName">Lenante</em>, which is not so white, nor so bright, insomuche
            that some doe say, that it is spice of <em class="name">Charabe</em> or <em class="name">succino</em>, 
            which is called Amber congeled, wherwith they doe make
            Beades, but it not so, for that the <em class="name">Charabe</em> is a kinde of
            Pitche, that is founde in the <span class="placeName">Germayne Sea</span>, and it is ta-
            ken out of the Sea in great peeces, with a dragge of Iron, 
            so that it seemth to come foorth of some fountaines, into
            the Sea, after the manner of pitch, and beeing come foorthe
            unto the colde ayre, it congeleth, for becayse there is scene in
            the same, peeces of stickes, &amp; other superfluities of the Sea,
            cleaving unto it, and in this they shall see the errour of them,
            that say that it is Gumme of <em class="name">Alamo</em>; and of others, that it
            is of the pinetree.</p>
         
         <p> Of our <em class="name">Anime</em> <span class="persName">Hermolaus Barbarus</span>, a man most excel
            
            lenly learned doeth saie, that it is gathered about the place 
            where Incence is founde, and that lande on soile, is called
            <em class="placeName">Amintin</em> and therefore the thing is called <em class="name">Anime.</em></p>
         
         <p>That which is brought from the <span class="placeName">newe Spaine</span>, is ga-
            thered from certaine Trees, of a reasonable greatnesse, by
            way of incision, as the Incence, and <em class="name">Almafiga</em> are gathe-
            red: we do use thereof for many infirmities, and principally
            for the griefe of the head, and paines therof, caused of hu-
            mours, or of colde causes, and for stuffying in the head, that
            thereof doeth proceede, after evacuation, perfuming there-
             with the chambers in the Winter season: and where as are
            generall infirmities, it doeth purifie and correct the Aire,
            and they doe perfume therewith their head kerchers, when 
            that they doe goe to sleepe: for them that doe suffer paines
            in the head, and occasions thereof, it doeth profite to per-
            fume the head of him that is so diseased, it doeth comforte
            the head unto such as have it debilited, or weakened, and
            doe suffer paines by occasion thereof: they doe put it also
            in plaisters, and in seere clothes, where as is neede of com- 
            fort, and to dissolve, especially cold humours, or windiness:
            they doe use it also in place of Incence, as well in the per-
            fumes, as in the aforesaide.</p>

         <h2>Of the gumme called Tacamabaca.</h2>
         
         <p><span style="text-transform:uppercase; font-size:200%;">A</span>nd also they doe bring out of the <span class="placeName">newe Spaine</span>
            an other kinde of Gumme or Rosine, which the
            Indians doe call <em class="name">Tacamabaca</em>, and the same 
            name did our Spaniard give it, it is Rosine
            
            taken out by incision of a tree, being as great as a Willow
            tree, and is of a berie sweete smell, it bringeth foorth a red
            fruite, as the seede of pionia.</p>
         
         <p>This Rosine on Gumme, the Indians doe much use in
            their infirmities, chiefly in the swellinges in any part of the bo-
            die, wheresoever they bee <span class="choice"><a class="orig">ingendred</a><a class="reg">injured</a></span>, for that it dissolveth,
            ripeneth, and marvellously desolveth them. And even so, it
            taketh awaie any manner of <span class="choice"><a class="orig">greefe</a><a class="reg">grief</a></span>, that is come of a colde
            cause: as humours, and windinesse: this th Indians doe use
            very commonly, and familiarly. And for this effect the Spa-
            niardes hath brought it.</p>
         
         <p>The colour is as the colour of <em class="name">Galmano</em>, and some doe
            say that it is the same, it hath white partes like to <em class="name">Amoni-
               aco</em>, it is of a good smel, and the tail is like, insomuch that be-
            in cast upon hotte burning <span class="choice"><a class="orig">coles</a><a class="reg">coals</a></span>, and giving the smoke
            thereof at the <span class="choice"><a class="orig">nase</a><a class="reg">nose</a></span> of a woman that doth swoone, or els hath
            lost her feeling by suffocation of the mother, it doeth cause
            her to come quickely, and easily to her selfe. And the Rosine
            putte to her navell, after the manner of a plaister, causeth
            the Mother to keepe in her place: and the use thereof is so
            much amongeth women, that the most parte which is spent
            thereof, if for this effect, for that they doe finde themselves
            very much eased by it, taking awaie from them all manner
            of chokinges of the Mother, and comforting the stomacke.
            Some that bee curious doe adde thereuntoo Amber and
            Muske, and so it is better then alone. It is <span class="choice"><a class="orig">alwaies</a><a class="reg">always</a></span> fixed,
            without melting of it selfe, untill that it bee all wholie wa-
            sted. </p>
         
         <p>And where it doeth most profite, is for to take awaie
            any manner of griefe caused of colde humours and windie,
            and beeing applied unto them in manner of a plaister, it ta-
            keth them away, and dissolveth them with greate admira-
            tion: it doeth cleave in such sorte, that until it hath done,
            and wrought his effect, it can not bee taken away, and the
            selfe same it doeth, being laide uppon swellinges, for that it
            
            consumeth and desolveth them, and if there bee any desire to
            ripen them, it doeth it, and that very quickly.</p>
         
         <p>It is also a remedie verified, and experimented
            that it doeth profite much in <span class="choice"><a class="orig">Reumes</a><a class="reg">Rheums</a></span> , and Runnings,
            wheresoever they goe, for it taketh them awaie, put-
            ting a small peece a linnen cloth with this Rosine, be-
            hinde both the eares, or the eare on the parte which run-
            neth, for that it doeth restraine the running of them: and ap-
            plied unto the temples of the head, in manner of a plaister,
            it doeth withholde the runnings and the fluxe, that runneth 
            to the eyes, and to the partes of the face: it taketh away the
            <span class="choice"><a class="orig">toth</a><a class="reg">tooth</a></span> ache, although that the <span class="choice"><a class="orig">tothe</a><a class="reg">tooth</a></span> bee hollowe, and if therewith the
            rotten <span class="choice"><a class="orig">tothe</a><a class="reg">tooth</a></span> be burned, it maketh that the corruption goeth
            no further: and being laide after the manner of a plaister in
            the hollownesse of the necke, or griefe of the shoulders, it
            taketh away the paynes: mingled with the thirde parte of
            <span class="unclear">storax</span>, and a little Amber made in a plaister, for the sto-
            macke, it doeth comfort it, and causeth appetite to meate,
            it helpeth digestion, and dissolveth windines: after the same
            sort put upon the moulde of the head, it comforteth, and ta-
            keth away the paines thereof. In the Sciatica, or paynes
            of the <span class="choice"><a class="orig">hippes</a><a class="reg">hips</a></span> put thereunto, the effect thereof is greate:
            and likewise it is so in all paynes of the <span class="choice"><a class="orig">ioyntes</a><a class="reg">joints</a></span>: and in any
            payne of the body whersoever, it be, chiefly if it come of cold
            humours, or <span class="choice"><a class="orig">mixt</a><a class="reg">mixed</a></span>: For because with this resolution, it hath
            partes of binding, which doe give a marvellous comfor-
            ting in <span class="choice"><a class="orig">ioyntes</a><a class="reg">joints</a></span>, or in hurtes of Sinewes putting that a-
            lone, it doeth heale and cure them, for greate is the expe-
            rience, that wee have of it, <span class="choice"><a class="orig">ingenderying</a><a class="reg">engendering</a></span> foorth with matter:
            it taketh away an extreme colde: ordinarily it is applyed

            yellowe Waxe, for that will be applied the better, and the
            use thereof is so celebrated, that the people knowe no other
            remedy for any grief, but only the use of this Rosine, so that
            
            it bee not inflamations very hotte, and also in them after

            it bee somewhat more strong of smell, it is very oylie, and
            it cleaneth fast without melting, for the clamminesse that it
            hath. It is a newe Medicine, and brought hither about a
            tenne yeers past, and the Indians doe use it in their infir-
            mities at against swellinges, and in all manner of griefes, and
            now in our parties it is much esteemed, for the great effects
            that it doth worke.</p>  
         
         <p>It doth profit and heale the same infirmities, that the <em class="name">Ta-

            infirmities, wherein the <em class="name">Tacamabaca</em> doth not so much ef-

            healed, until hee had put thereunto the <em class="name">Caranna</em>, and there-

            much easinesse. In old swellinges, as well in humours as
            in windes, it dissolveth, in griefes caused by refluxe or run- 
               
            ning of cold humours or mixed, it worketh a marvellous ef-

            or great efficacie, and doth make his worke with great cer-
            taintie in new greene wounds, especially of the Sinewes:

            that the Spaniards have called, oyle of
            the fig tree of Hell, for that it is taken
            from a tree that is no more nor lesse then
            our fig tree of Hel, aswel in the Leafe,
            as in the Fruite: it is the same that wee

            the grosnes of the earth. </p>
         
         <p>The Indians doe make this oyle, as <em class="persName">Dioscorides</em> doeth
            <span class="choice"><a class="orig">shewe</a><a class="reg">show</a></span>, in the first booke, the xxx.Chapter, that is do pounde

            the use thereof hath beene seene, and well in the Indias, as
            in our partes, and all that I will say, is of very greate
            experience, and much use thereof in many persons: it doeth
            heale and cure all infirmities caused of cold humours, and
            windines, it doth dissolve all hardnes with mollification, and
            all inflamations being windie: it taketh away all manner
            of paine in what parte soever it bee, chiefly if it come of any
            colde sause, or windines, for that in this, it maketh a mar-
            vellous woorke, dissolving greate windinesse, wheresoever
            it bee, and especially in the belly: and with this they do
            heale a windy dropsie, &amp; lykewyse al kindes thereof, annoyn-
            ting there withal the Belly, and Stomacke, taking some
            droppes therof with wine, or other licour appropriated, that
            it may <span class="choice"><a class="orig">auoyde</a><a class="reg">aid</a></span> the citrine water, and make the winde to be

            or twoo with milke, or with some some sae grosse thing. And for

            swellinges, so that they come not of a very hotte cause, it ta-

            king away the griefe if that there bee any: it taketh away
            any markes or signes, whersoever they bee in the face,
            principally, and the Morphe we which women many tymes
            bee troubled withall, the anoynting with this Oyle, doeth
            take it away, and consumeth it, not with litle content to them

            where it groweth, and did feele such a sweete smell, they
            thought that there had been spices and trees thereof.</p>
         
         <p>There is brought much quantitie of <em class="name">Liquid Amber</em> in
            to <span class="placeName">Spaine</span>, inso much that they do bring many pipes, and
            <span class="choice"><a class="orig">Barelles</a><a class="reg">Barrels</a></span> full thereof to sell for Merchaundise, for heere
            they raise profite thereof, to perfume in thinges of sweete
            
            smelles, wafting it in place of <em class="name">Storax</em>, for that the smoke
            and smell deoth seeme to be the same: and also they doe put it
            into other confections of sweete smelles to burne, and suche
            like thinges. It casteth from it so much smell without bur-
            ning of it, that wheresoever it be, it cannot be hidden, but
            doth penetrate many houses and streets with the sweete
            smell, when there is quantity of it.</p>
         
         <p>It serveth much in medicine, &amp; doth therein greate effect,
            for that it healeth, comforteth, dissolveth, and mittigateth
            payne applied unto the Moulde of the heades by it selfe, or
            migled with other thinges <em>Aromaticall</em>, it doth comfort
            the braines, and taketh away the paines of any manner of
            griefe, proceeding of a coulde cause layed after the manner
            of a playster thereunto, it doeth also mitigate, and take a-
            way the paynes, &amp;griefes or the stomacke, wherein it doth
            a marvellous effect, applied after the maner of a Stoma-
            cher. For that it doth comfort the Stomake, and doeth dis-
            solve windes, and helpe digestion, and take away rawnesse
            it causeth the meate to be well digested, it geveth lust to eate:
            it is made of <em class="name">Liquide Amber</em>, spreade abroade upon a sheeps
            skinne, in the forme of a breastplate, mindled with a little
            <em class="name">Storax</em>, <em class="name">Amber</em> and <em>Muske</em>, it is a Playster which doeth
            profite muche in all that I have sayed. There is knowne of
            this playster very great experience, in this citie, for the
            good effect that it worketh: it is hot in the ende of the second
            degree, but moyst in the first. </p>
         
         <p>Out of this <em class="name">Liquid Amber</em>, is taken the Oyle that is cal-
            led the oyle of <em class="name">Liquide Amber</em>, the which in his smel is more
            sweet, it it taken out ot the <em class="name">Liquide Amber</em> when it is newly
            gathered, putting it in parte where it may distill of it selfe,
            (the more subtill) is the perfectest and best of all.</p>
         
         <p>Others there be that do presse it, because the more quan-
            titie thereof may be taken out, &amp;they bring it for merchaun-
            dise, for that that use to dresse Gloves therwith for the com-
            mon people, and in this trade there is much spent.</p>
         
         
         <p>It is used in Medicine for many diseases, and it is of
            greate vertue to heale colde diseases, for it healeth excellent-
            ly well al partes wheresoever it be applied, it dissolveth and
            mollisieth any maner of hardnes, taking away the paynes:
            it dissolveth the hardnesse of the Mother, and openeth the o-
            pilations thereof. It provoketh the Monethly course in wo-
            men, and it maketh soft any maner of hard thing. It is hotte
            welneere in the third degree.</p>
         
         <p>And it is to be noted, that many doe bring this Storax
            very thin from the Indias, which is not so good, for because
            that they make it of the bowes of the trees, cut in pieces,
            and sodden, and they gather the fatnes that swimmeth upon:
            and the Indians doe sell the buddes of the rees whereout the
            Liquid Amber is taken, made in handfulles, &amp; doe sell it in
            their market places, for to put amongst their clothes, which 
            causeth them to smell, as of the water of Angels, &amp; for this
             purpose the Spaniards doe use it.</p> </div>

         <h2>Of the Balsamo.</h2>
         
         <p>The doe bring from the <span class="placeName">newe Spayne</span> that licour
            most excellent, which for his excellencie and mervel-
            lous effects, is called <em class="name">Balsamo</em>, and imitation of the
            true <em class="name">Balsamo</em>, that was in the land of <span class="placeName">Egypt</span>, and for
            that it doeth such great workes, and remedie so many infir-
            mities, there was geven to it such a name. It is made of a
            tree greater than a <span class="choice"><a class="orig">Powngarnet</a><a class="reg">Pomegranate</a></span> Tree, it carrieth leaves
            like to Nettles: the Indians doe call it <em class="name">Xilo</em>, and we doe call
            the same <em class="name">Balsamo</em>. It is made two maner of waies, the one
            is by the way of incision, cutting the rynd of the Tree, which
            is thinne, geving many small cuttinges, out of the which
            there commeth a clammish licour, of colour white, but it
            is little and moste excellent, and very perfect. The other fa-
            shion is, whereby the Indians doe use too take out licour of
            
            the trees, which is a common use amongst them is this: they
            take the bowes and the great peeces of the trees, and make
            them as small, as they can, and then craft them into a greate
            kettle, with a good quantity of water, &amp; so boyle them untill
            they see it sufficiently done, and afterwarde they let it coole,
            and gather up the oyle that doeth swimme thereuppon with
            certayne shelles, and that is the <em class="name">Balsamo</em> that commeth too
            these partes, and that commonly is used: the colour therof is
            Alborne, which is likened to blacke, it is of most sweet smel,
            and very excellent. It is not convenient, nor it ought to bee
            kept in any other vessel then in silver (Glasse or <span class="choice"><a class="orig">Tinne</a><a class="reg">Tin</a></span>, or a-
            ny other thing glassed, it doeth penitrate and doeth passe 
            through:) the use thereof is onely in thinges apperteining 
            to Medicine, and it hath been used of long time, well neere
            since the <span class="placeName">new Spaine</span> was discovered, for that incontinent the
            Spaniards had knowledge of it, because they did heale
            therewith the woundes that they did receive of the Indians,
            being advised of the vertue thereof by the same Indians, and
            they did see the saide Indians heale and cure themselves
            therewith.</p>
         
         <p>When it first came into <span class="placeName">Spayne</span>, it was esteemed as
            much as it was reason it shoulde be, for that they did see it
            make mervellous woorkes, one ownce was woorth tenne 
            Duccates and upwardes, and now it is better cheape: the
            first time that they carried it to Rome, it came to be woorth
            one ounce, one hundreth Duccats: &amp; after that they brought 
            so much and such greate quantity, that it is nowe of small va-
            lue: this commeth of the abundance of thinges. And when
            it was very deere all men tooke profite of the profite of it,
            and since it came to bee of so lower a price, it is not so
            much esteemed beeyng the selfe same <em class="name">Balsamo</em>, that it
            was then when it was woorth on hundreth Duccates 
            the ounce. Surely if the Indias had not beene disco-
            vered, but onely for the effects, to send us this mervellous
            licour, the labour had been wel employed which our Spani-
            
            ardes have taken for that the <em class="name">Balsamo</em> that was used to be
            had in <span class="placeName">Egypt</span>, it is many yeeres since it failed, because the
            Vine from whence it came, dried by, wherby you have now
            none in the worlde. Our Lorde God did thinke it good in 
            place of that geve us this <em class="name">Balsamo</em>, of the <span class="placeName">newe Spayne</span>,
            the which in my iudgement in Medicinal vertue, is no <span class="choice"><a class="orig">whie</a><a class="reg">way</a></span>
            inferior unto that of <span class="placeName">Egypt</span>, accroding to the great effects
            that we doe see in it, and the great profite that it doeth, which
            we doe see in Medicines, in three wayes: that is to say, it is
            taken at the mouth, or it is applied outwardly, or it serveth
            in thinges of Surgery. Taken in the morning fasting, it 
            healeth the shortnesse of breath: it taketh away the diseases
            of the bladder: it provoketh the <span class="choice"><a class="orig">Menstrues</a><a class="reg">Menstruation</a></span> of Women taken
            and applied with a Pessary: it taketh away the olde paynes
            of the stomacke, licking certayne droppes therof in the mor-
            ning fasting, layde upon the palme of the hande, and so con-
            tinued: it doeth comforte the stomacke: it doeth rectify the
            Liver: it maketh a good colour in the face, it maketh a good
            breathing, it openeth the Breast, it undoeth opilations, and
            conserveth youth. I know a person of much estimation that
            did use it, and beeyng of great yeers, did looke like a young
            man, and lived after he used it without occasion of any evill.
            They which have been troubled with a dry cough have u-
            sed it, and to some it hath beene profitable, and some Gen-
            tle women that have not brought foorth Children, have u-
            sed it in tentes for too purge the Mother, and it hath done
            them good.</p>
         
         <p>It hath beene also applyed outwardly in all manner of
            griefes caused of coulde humours, or of windes. For that
            beyng continued, it taketh away very well any manner of
            griefe, applied hot, with a little fether, and laying there-
            upon a cloth wet with the selfe same <em class="name">Balsamo</em>, it is dissolva-
            tive, and so it doeth consume and undoe swellinges colde
            and olde. It strengtheneth any part where it is put unto,
            the foreparte of the heade it doeth comforte mervellously,
              
            and taketh away the paynes thereof, consuming any man-
            ner of humour or colde that is in it: taketh away the pal-
            sey by annoynting the foreheade and Necke, and the
            partes that bee impotent, and it doeth profite in all in-
            firmities of Sinewes, and shrinkinges of them. Applied
            unto the stomacke, it helpeth digestion, and comforteth it,
            dissolving windinesse: and if there bee any opilation, it o-
            peneth it. And also the opilations of the inner partes it
            doeth mollifie and soften: it taketh away the payne of the
            Stone in the kidneies or <span class="choice"><a class="orig">Raynes</a><a class="reg">Pains</a></span>, beyng layde hot uppon
            the grieved place: in the paynes of the Bellie or Sto-
            macke caused of colde or wyndes, beeyng put thereunto hot,
            or layed uppon hotte Breade taken out of the Oven, it ta-
            keth them away, it provoketh Urine, and them that cannot
            pisse, applying it outwardly, and taking a fewe drops
            thereof, it doeth unloose and expelleth it: in the paynes
            of the <span class="choice"><a class="orig">ioyntes</a><a class="reg">joints</a></span> it hath mervellous effect, and in these it hath
            a speciall Perogative, and especially in the <em class="name">Sciatica</em>, dis-
            solveth any manny of hardnesse or swelling that remay-
            neth in any such griefe: in paynes of the Sinowes it is a
            mervellous remedie, and in all runninges of fluxe, it doeth
            stoppe and heale. </p>
         
         <p>This <em class="name">Balsamo</em> being applied in practice of Surgery hath
            great effects, of it selfe, or mingled any other way with me-
            edicine, that hath vertue to doe the effect whersoever it is ap-
            plied, and to shew all the vertues thereof, it would be verye
            long. I do remit it to him that shall use it, that he may make
            they myxture that shall be necessary and convenient.</p>
         
         <p>The <em class="name">Balsamo</em> is a verye common and used remedie for
            woundes being newe, for that it doth cure them by the first
            intention, gleweing together the partes without making
            matter, and where there be bruses that cannot be glewed
            together, it doeth a verye good worke, makyng dige-
            stion with readinesse, and in the rest of the workes that
            appertaine to Surgerie, it doth that which is convenient
            
            untill the woundes be whole, and for this cause the use ther-
            of is a common medicine in all sergery for poore folkes, see-
            ing that as with one medicine all effectes are wrought there-
            with, that are necessary: &amp;it is a common thing to say, that
            when one is hurt, let <em class="name">Balsamo</em> be put thereunto, and so they
            doe, &amp; it doth heale them. In the woundes of Sinewes it
            woorketh a mervellous effect, for that it doeth cure &amp;
            heale. It healeth better then any other medicine doeth, it re-
            sisteth colde, the woundes of the head it healeth very well, not
            having the Skull broken, not perished.</p>
         
         <p>Any manner of woundes bbeyng freshe it doeth heale in
            any parte of the dodie wheresoever they bee, so that there
            be no more in it but a simple wounde. In <span class="choice"><a class="orig">ioyntes</a><a class="reg">joints</a></span> what
            manner of woundes soever it bee, it doeth make a marvel-
            lous woorke: The use thereof is very common in this Ci-
            tie, in woundes. For that you have fewe houses, but you
            have <em class="name">Balsamo</em> in them for this effect, so that in wounding of
            any person foorthwith they goe to the <em class="name">Balsamo</em>, for with lit-
            tle quantities thereof they do cure and heale, and many
            times with putting of it once every thirde day, they finde
            the woundes whole. In olde sores applied by it selfe, or with
            any other oyntment, it doeth mundifie, and fill them uppe
            with fleshe.</p>
         
         <p>In large fevers <em class="name">Paroxismales</em> beyng layde halfe an houre
            before the colde doeth come, uppon the moulde of the heade
            very hot, the patient being very well covered with clothes,
            and taking forthwith five or sixe droppes thereof in wine, it
            taketh away the colde, in three or foure times doing it. It is
            of a sharpe savour and somewhat bitter, whereby are seen the
            dry partes and comfortative that it hath: it is hot and dry in
            the second degree.</p>
         
         <p>I will not let to write of a certayne Hearbe, which the
            Conquerours of the <span class="placeName">newe Spaine</span> doe use for the remedy of
            their wounds, and shottes of arrowes, which unto them was
            a great remedie in their troubles, and it was discovered by
            
            an Indian, which was Servant too a Spaniarde called
            <span class="persName">John Infant</span>. He was the first that used it, they did call it,
            and doe call it at this present day, the <span class="name">Hearbe of John In-
               fant</span>: this hearbe is little, they gather it greene, and beate
            it, and so they lay it simply upon the wound: it doth restraine
            and stoppe the blood, and if it be a wounde in the fleshe, it
            doth cause it to growe together, and healeth it by glewing
            the partes. The woundes of the Sinewes, and other
            partes it doth comfort, mundifie, and ingendreth flesh in them
            untill they be whole, and because they doe not find this hearb
            in all places, they bring it made into pouder, for that it
            woorketh the same effect as well as being greene, and the 
            pouder, as some say, doth it better than the hearbe.</p>
         
         <p>As this hearbe, so likewise have you many other in all
            the other partes of the <span class="placeName">Indias</span>, that have the same and other
            properties &amp; doe woorke mervellous effects: and to write of
            every one of them particularly, it were needefull to make a
            greater volume, then wee doe pretende of this that we shall
            entreate of.</p>
         
         <p>Three thinges they bring from our <span class="placeName">Occidentall Indi-
               as</span>, which at this day bee celebrated in all the worlde, and
            with them they have made &amp; doe make the greatest workes
            that ever were made in medicine, &amp; there were never the like
            made, by any other medicine that unto this day hath beene
            knowen, for that the nature of al three is to cure infirmities,
            which without this remedy be incurable, and to woorke the
            effectes that doe seeme to bee thinges of woonder, and these
            are notorious, not onely in these parts, but in all the worlde:
            the which thinges are the wood that is called <em class="name">Guaiacan</em>, the
            <em class="name">China</em> and the <em class="name">Sarcaparillia</em>. And for that it seemeth that
            the <em class="name">China</em> doth come from <span class="placeName">Portingall</span>, and that the portin-
            gales doe bring it from their <span class="placeName">Orientall Indias</span>, and not from
            ours, I willsay what it to be said herafter when we do speak
            thereof. And therefore let us beginne with <em class="name">Guaiacan</em>, as of
            a remedie that first came from the <span class="placeName">Indias</span>, and as first of the
            
            best of all, as exprience hath shewed, and the use thereof in
            so many yeares.

         <h2>Of the Guaiacan and of the holie Wood.</h2>
         
         <p><span style="text-transform:uppercase; font-size:200%;">T</span>he <em class="name">Guaiacan</em>, that is called the wood of
            the <span class="placeName">Indias</span> was discovered forthwith, when
            the first <span class="placeName">Indias</span> were found, which was the
            Island of <em class="placeName">Sancto Domingo</em>, where is great
            quantity thereof. There was an Indian
            that gave knowledge thereof to his Mai-
            ster, in this maner. Ther was a Spaniard
            that did suffer great paines of the Poxe, which he had taken
            by the company of an Indian woman, but his servant being
            one of the Phisitions of that countrie, gave unto him the wa-
            ter of <em class="name">Guaiacan</em>, wherewith not onely his grievous paynes
            were taken away that he did suffer, but he was healed verie
            well of the evill: with the which many other Spaniardes,
            that were infected with the same evill were healed also, the
            which was communicated immediatly, with them that came
            from thence, hither to <em class="placeName">Seuill</em>, and from thence it was divul-
            ged throughout all <span class="placeName">Spaine</span>, and from thence through all the
            world, for that the infection was sowen abroade throughout
            all partes thereof: and surely for this evill it is the best, &amp; the
            most chieferemedy of as many hirtherto have been found,
            and with most assurance, and most certentie, it healeth
            and cureth the sayde disease, if they be wel handled: and this
            water given as it ought to be, it is certaine that it healeth it
            most perfectly, without turning to fall againe, except the
            sicke man doe returne to tumble in the same bosome, where
            be tooke the first infection.</p>
         
         <p>Our Lord God would from whence the evill of the Poxe
            came, form thence shoulde com ethe remedy for them. Since
            it is knowne that they came into these parts from the Indi-
            
            as, and first of all from <em class="placeName">Sancto Domingo.</em> The Poxe bee as
            common amongest the Indians, and as familiare, as the
            Measelles bee unto us, and well neere the most part of the
            Indians, both men and women have them, wihtout making
            thereof any scruple, and they came first in this sorte.</p>
         
         <p>In the yeere of our Lorde God 1493. in the <span class="choice"><a class="orig">warres</a><a class="reg">wars</a></span>
            that the Catholike King made in <span class="placeName">Naples</span>, with <span class="persName">King
               Charles</span> of <span class="placeName">France</span>, that was called <span class="persName">Great head</span>, in this time
            sir <span class="persName">Christopher Colon</span>, returned from the discoverie that hee
            had made of the <span class="placeName">Indias</span>, which was <em class="placeName">Sancto Domingo</em>, and o-
            ther Islands, &amp; he brought with him from <em class="placeName">Sancto Domingo</em>,
            a great number of Indians, both men and women, which
            be carried with him to <span class="placeName">Naples</span>, where the Catholike king
            was at that tyme, who had then concluded the <span class="choice"><a class="orig">warres</a><a class="reg">wars</a></span>, for
            that there was peace betweene the twoo Kinges, and the
            hostes did communicate together, the one with the other.
            And <span class="persName">Colon</span> being come thither with his Indians, the most
            part of them brought with them the fruit of their countrie,
            which was the Poxe. And the Spaniardes began to have
            conversation with the Indian women, in such sorte, that the
            men and women of the Indias, did infect the campe of the
            Spaniardes, Italians, and Almaines, for the Catholike
            king had then of all these Nations, and there were many
            that were infected with the evill. And after the hostes com-
            moned together, the fire did kindle in the campe of the king
            of <span class="placeName">France</span>, of which it folowed, that in short tyme the one
            and the other were infected with this evill seede: and from
            thence it hath spred abrode into all the worlde.</p>
         
         <p>
            At the beginning it had diverse names: the Spaniards
            did thinke that it had beene given them by the French-
            men, and they called it the <span class="placeName">Frenche</span> evil. The Frenchmen
            thought that in <span class="placeName">Naples</span>, and by them of the Countrie, the
            evill had beene given them, and they called it the evil of <span class="placeName">Na-
               ples</span>. And they of <span class="placeName">Almaine</span> seing that by conversation with
            the Spaniards, they came by it, they called it the Spa-
            
            nishe Skabbe, and other called it the Measelles of the <span class="placeName">In-
               dias</span>, and that very truely, seing that from thence came the
            evill in the beginning.</p>
         
         <p>Amongest the great phisitions of that tyme, there were
            sundry great opinions of the cause, and originall of the in-
            firmitie. The one sort sayde that it came of the evil me-
            lancholie meates, that the hostes of necessitie had eaten, as
            wilde hearbes, and many gardeine hearbes, and rootes of
            hearbes, asses, and horses, and other lyke things, that
            ingender such lyke infirmities, corrupting and burnyng
            the blood. Others there were, that did attribute it to the
            coniunctions of Saturne and Mars, and they did apply it
            to the heavenly influence, and gave thereuntoo <span class="choice"><a class="orig">divers</a><a class="reg">diverse</a></span> and
            sundrynames. Some called it the Leprosie, others Swine
            Poxe, other Mentegra, others the Deathly evill, others
            Elephansia, without certaine assurance that disease it
            was. For they were ignoraunt that it was a newe disease,
            and they woulde reduce it to some already knowen and writ-
            ten of. And nowe we come to our <em class="name">Guaiacan</em>, whose name
            was given by the Indians, and of them very well knowen,
            and so they have called it and do call it, in all the world, cal-
            ling it also the woodde of the <span class="placeName">Indias</span>. Of this woodde ma-
            ny have written and much, one sort sayeng that it was <em class="name">eba-
               no</em>, others that it was a kinde of Boxe, with many other
            names wherby they have named it. It is a new tree and ne-
            ver seene in our partes, nor in any other of the discoveries, &amp;
            as the country is newe, so is the tree a newe thing also.</p>
         
         <p>Whatsoever it be, it is a  great tree, of the greatnesse of
            an Oke: it casteth out many bowes, the einde it doth cast
            from it being dry, greate, and full of Gumme, the hart
            thereof is very greatm it is well neere lyke to blacke, all is
            very hard as much and more then <em class="name">Ebano</em> is. It casteth forth
            a little leafe and hard, and every yeere it bringeth foorth yel-
            low flowers, out of the which is ingendered a round fruite,
            with litle kernelles within it, of the greatnesse of a Medler:
            
            of these Trees there is greate aboundance in <em class="placeName">Sancto Do-
               mingo.</em></p>
         
         <p>And after this they have founde an other Tree, of the
            kind of this <em class="name">Guaiacan</em>, in <span class="placeName">Saint John de <em class="placeName">Puerto Rico</em></span>, which
            is an other islande neere to that of <em class="placeName">Sancto Domingo</em>, such an
            other tree as that is, saving that it is lesse, &amp; the body of the
            tree and the bowes are smaller, &amp; it hath scarcely any harte,
            or if it have any, it is very little, and htat is in the body of the
            tree, for that the bowes have none at all: It is of more sweete
            smel and more bitter then the <em class="name">Guaiacan</em>, that is now used in
            our tyme, I meane that of <em class="placeName">Sancto Domingo</em>, and for his mar-
            vellous effects, they called it the holy Woode, &amp;surely with
            reason: for that it is of a better working then that of <em class="placeName">Sancto
               Domingo</em>, which is seene by experience, but even aswell the
            one &amp; the other is a marvellous remedy, to cure the disease
            of the Poxe: of the which and of every one of them a wa-
            ter is made, and is taken for this infirmitie, and for many
            others in this forme.</p>
         
         <p>They take twelve ounces of the wood made small, and
            twoo ounces of the Rinde of the same wooddee broken, and
            they cast it to steepe in three pottels of Water, in a newe
            pot, that will holde somwhat more, for the space of XXiiii.
            houres: and the pot being well stopt, they seeth it over a soft
            fire of kindles Coales, untill the twoo Pottels bee sodde a-
            way, and one remayning. And this is to be noted at the time
            the water is put to it, putting there in one Pottle, they dip
            in a little Rodde, and doe marke howe high the water of
            one Pottle reacheth, and by that measure and marke they
            shall see when the twoo are sodde away, and the one Pottell
            remayneth. After the water is sodden, they set it to coole, &amp;
            straine it, and keepe it in a glasses vessel, and forthwith up-
            pon the said sodden woodde, they poure foure pottels of wa-
            ter, and seeth it till on bee sodden away, and this water
            must be strayned and kept apart, and it must bee taken in
            this forme. </p>
         
         
         <p>After that the sicke man is purged by the counsell of a
            <span class="choice"><a class="orig">phisition</a><a class="reg">physician</a></span>, let him be put into a warme Chamber, and kept
            from the colde and from ayre, and beeing laied in his bedde,
            let him take early in the morning tenne ounces of Water, 
            of that which was first made wel warmed, and let him bee
            covered so that her may sweate wel, &amp; let him kepe his sweat
            at the least two houres, &amp; after he hath swet, let him be made
            cleane from his sweat, &amp; take a warme shirt, and the rest of
            his linen clothes, &amp; foure houres after he hath swette, let
            him eate Reasings, Almonds, and Bisket, and that in reaso-
            nable quantitie. Then let him drinke of the water that was
            made at the second tyme, the quantity that he hath need of
            and of the selfe same let him drinke in the day time, &amp; eight
            houres after he hath eaten, let him returne to take the first
            water, and let him take other tenne ounces well warmed,
            and then sweate other twoo houres, and after his sweate let
            him bee made cleane, and then bee covered againe with
            warme cloathes, and one houre after hee hath swet, let him
            make his supper of the same Reasings, Almonds, and Bis-
            ket, and drinke of the second Water. This order he must ob-
            serve the first fiftiene daies, except hee have some notable
            weaknesse, and in such case hee must be succoured with ge-
            ving him to eate of a young Chicken, <span class="choice"><a class="orig">iointly</a><a class="reg">jointly</a></span>, with the rest of
            the Diet: and in them that be leane, that cannot beare for pre-
            cise Diet, it is sufficient that they take it for nine dayes, and 
            at the end of them they may eate a little Chicken rosted, &amp; if
            in a case the sicke person be <span class="choice"><a class="orig">debilited</a><a class="reg">debilitated</a></span>, and that he cannot suf-
            fer the Diet, let him have from the beginning a very small
            Chicken, going forwarde increasing in the proces of tyme,
            and beeing past the 15. dayes, let him return to purge
            himselfe at the sixtiene dayes end, &amp;let him take to the waight
            of five shillinges of the substaunce of <em class="name">Canafistola</em>, taken out
            by Strayner or other thing respondent thereunto, and
            that day let him drinke no strong water, but of the simple,
            and the next day after the Purgation, let him return to
            
            the aforesayde order, taking in the morning and evening
            the strong water with his sweatinges, and eating and drin-
            king the same. Saving that in place of a Chicken hee
            may eate halfe a rosted Pullet, or somwhatmore, and
            this seconde tyme let him take it for other xx. daies, in the
            which tyme hee may ryse, and walke about his chamber,
            being apparelled and kept warme. And at the end of them,
            hee shall returne to purge himselfe an other tyme, and
            must have a speciall care to keepe good order, and after hee
            hath taken the water for other fortie dayes, must keepe him-
            selfe from women and from wyne especially: and in place
            of wyne, he must drinke the simple water of the woodde,
            which if he will not doe, then let him drinke of water sodden
            with Anise seede or Fenell seede, supping little at night and
            eating no flesh.</p>
         
         <p>This is the best way that the water of the wood ought
            to be taken, which doeth heale many infirmities incurable,
            where other Medicines could not worke the same effect, &amp;
            this water is the best remedy that is in the worlde, to heale
            the disease of the Poxe, whatsoever or what kinde soe-
            ver it bee, for that it rooteth it out for ever without any
            more comming againe, and in this it hath his principal pre-
            rogative and excellencie. This water is also good for the
            Dropsy, for the shortnes of breath, for the Falling sicknes,
            for the diseases of the Bladder, and of the Rayne, for the
            payne of the Joynts, for all evils caused of cold humours,
            for <span class="choice"><a class="orig">ventositie</a><a class="reg">ventosity</a></span>, and other dangerous and importunate disea-
            ses, where the ordinary benefites of <span class="choice"><a class="orig">Phisicions</a><a class="reg">Physicians</a></span> have not pro-
            fited. Chiefly it excelleth where the evil dispositions be, that
            have proceeded at any tyme from the disease of the Poxe. 
            There be many that with this woode have made sundry mix-
            tures, making Syropes therof, and surely with good effect.
            But my iudgement and opinion is, that he which shall take
            the water of the wood, ought ot take it in the maner as is a-
            above said, without any mingling thereof, for that by expe-
            
            perience it hath beene seene so to make the better woorke.
            This water is good for the teeth, making them white, and
            fastning them, by continual washing of them therewith: it is
            hot and dry in the second degree.</p>

            By this you shall understande, that <span class="persName">Syr Frauncis <em>de

            other little rootes, who asked mee, what rootes they were?
            I aunswered that they were rootes of the <em class="name">China</em>, but that
            they seemed to mee to bee very freshe. Hee sayde to mee,
            that so they were, and that it was not longe since that
            they had beene gathered and brought from the <span class="placeName">newe Spaine</span>.
            I narveled that they had it there, for I did beleeve that in
            the <em class="name">China</em> only it had growen: he said unto mee, that not only
            there was in the <span class="placeName">newe Spaine</span> the <em class="name">China</em>, but that also wee
            shoulde see brought greate quantitie of Spicerie from the

            into <span class="placeName">Spain</span> great quantitie of spicerie, that hee had begon

            Agues, with the Water of it, provoking Sweats, and
